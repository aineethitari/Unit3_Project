# Criteria A-Planning
## Problem Definition
My client has a large amount of clothing items, varying from different kinds of jewelries, tops, bottoms, to shoes. She often has trouble with how she can manage and keep track of where her clothing items go. After she stores one item in her wardrobe, they would disappear. One incident was when her father gave her jewelry that was passed on generations by generations, she lost the valuable family heirloom in her messy wardrobe. She felt extremely guilty and miserable that the tradition ended because of her. Since then, she decided to become a more organized person by using a tracker. She is in need of an application that will keep track of the items in her wardrobe that has the functions to let her add and remove items, organize by color, classify the items in categories, and is easy to go through.

## Rationale for Proposed Solution

## Success Criteria
1. The application has a login system that uses a password or a pin number
2. The application stores information in a database
3. The application provides a visual function to see items being classified in categories: jewelry, top, bottom, shoes
4. The application shows the brand of the item, the color, and the location of the item
5. The application allows the user to add and remove items
6. The application has a simple interface
